## Windows 64-bit

How to building with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 64-bit.

### Windows Tools Required

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or Visual Studio 2019
  ```shell
  winget install --id=Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.Professional -e
  ```
- [CMake (version 3.31)](https://cmake.org/) — **⚠️ version 3.31.x is mandatory**
  ```shell
  winget install --id=Kitware.CMake -v "3.31.6" -e
  ```
- [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/)
  ```shell
  winget install --id=StrawberryPerl.StrawberryPerl -e
  ```
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  ```shell
  winget install --id=Git.Git -e
  ```
- [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)
  ```shell
  winget install --id=GitHub.GitLFS -e
  ```

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Desktop (optional): A GUI for Git and Git LFS, which already includes both tools.
> ```shell
> winget install --id=GitHub.GitHubDesktop -e
> ```

### Windows Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   - If using GitHub Desktop clone the repository from the GUI.
   - If using the command line:
     1. Clone the repository:
     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer
     ```
     2. Run lfs to download tools on Windows:
     ```shell
     git lfs pull
     ```
2. Open the appropriate command prompt:
   - For Visual Studio 2019:  
     Open **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019** and run:
     ```shell
     build_release.bat
     ```
   - For Visual Studio 2022:  
     Open **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022** and run:
     ```shell
     build_release_vs2022.bat
     ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter issues, you can try to uninstall ZLIB from your Vcpkg library.

3. If successful, you will find the VS 2022 solution file in:
   ```shell
   build\OrcaSlicer.sln
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that CMake version 3.31.x is actually being used. Run `cmake --version` and verify it returns a **3.31.x** version.
> If you see an older version (e.g. 3.29), it's likely due to another copy in your system's PATH (e.g. from Strawberry Perl).
> You can run where cmake to check the active paths and rearrange your **System Environment Variables** > PATH, ensuring the correct CMake (e.g. C:\Program Files\CMake\bin) appears before others like C:\Strawberry\c\bin.

> [!NOTE]
> If the build fails, try deleting the `build/` and `deps/build/` directories to clear any cached build data. Rebuilding after a clean-up is usually sufficient to resolve most issues.

## MacOS 64-bit

How to building with Xcode on MacOS 64-bit.

### MacOS Tools Required

- Xcode
- CMake (version 3.31.x is mandatory)
- Git
- gettext
- libtool
- automake
- autoconf
- texinfo

> [!TIP]
> You can install most of them by running:
> ```shell
> brew install gettext libtool automake autoconf texinfo
> ```

Homebrew currently only offers the latest version of CMake (e.g. **4.X**), which is not compatible. To install the required version **3.31.X**, follow these steps:

1. Download CMake **3.31.7** from: [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Install the application (drag it to `/Applications`).
3. Add the following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```sh
export PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:$PATH"
```

4. Restart the terminal and check the version:

```sh
cmake --version
```

5. Make sure it reports a **3.31.x** version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've recently upgraded Xcode, be sure to open Xcode at least once and install the required macOS build support.

### MacOS Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer
   cd OrcaSlicer
   ```
2. Build the application:
   ```shell
   ./build_release_macos.sh
   ```
3. Open the application:
   ```shell
   open build/arm64/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer.app
   ```

### Debugging in Xcode

To build and debug directly in Xcode:

1. Open the Xcode project:
   ```shell
   open build/arm64/OrcaSlicer.xcodeproj
   ```
2. In the menu bar:
   - **Product > Scheme > OrcaSlicer**
   - **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme...**
     - Under **Run > Info**, set **Build Configuration** to `RelWithDebInfo`
     - Under **Run > Options**, uncheck **Allow debugging when browsing versions**
   - **Product > Run**

## Linux

Linux distributions are available in two formats: [using Docker](#using-docker) (recommended) or [building directly](#linux-build) on your system.

### Using Docker

How to build and run OrcaSlicer using Docker.

#### Docker Dependencies

- Docker
- Git

#### Docker Instructions

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer && cd OrcaSlicer && ./scripts/DockerBuild.sh && ./scripts/DockerRun.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

The `scripts/DockerRun.sh` script includes several commented-out options that can help resolve common issues. Here's a breakdown of what they do:

- `xhost +local:docker`: If you encounter an "Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified" error, run this command in your terminal before executing `scripts/DockerRun.sh`. This grants Docker containers permission to interact with your X display server.
- `-h $HOSTNAME`: Forces the container's hostname to match your workstation's hostname. This can be useful in certain network configurations.
- `-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix`: Helps resolve problems with the X display by mounting the X11 Unix socket into the container.
- `--net=host`: Uses the host's network stack, which is beneficial for printer Wi-Fi connectivity and D-Bus communication.
- `--ipc host`: Addresses potential permission issues with X installations that prevent communication with shared memory sockets.
- `-u $USER`: Runs the container as your workstation's username, helping to maintain consistent file permissions.
- `-v $HOME:/home/$USER`: Mounts your home directory into the container, allowing you to easily load and save files.
- `-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY`: Passes your X display number to the container, enabling the graphical interface.
- `--privileged=true`: Grants the container elevated privileges, which may be necessary for libGL and D-Bus functionalities.
- `-ti`: Attaches a TTY to the container, enabling command-line interaction with OrcaSlicer.
- `--rm`: Automatically removes the container once it exits, keeping your system clean.
- `orcaslicer $*`: Passes any additional parameters from the `scripts/DockerRun.sh` script directly to the OrcaSlicer executable within the container.

By uncommenting and using these options as needed, you can often resolve issues related to display authorization, networking, and file permissions.

### Ubuntu 26.04 (containerized build, native run)

Ubuntu 26.04 ships CMake 4.x, which `build_linux.sh` rejects. `scripts/ubuntu2604/build.sh` builds inside an `ubuntu:26.04` container (CMake 3.30, all `-dev` packages from `scripts/ubuntu2604/provision.sh`) under your UID, with the repo mounted at the same absolute path, at low CPU priority. No host `sudo` is needed. The resulting binary links against the same system libraries as the host and runs natively. Compiles go through ccache, kept in `~/.cache/snap-orca-ccache` (`SNAP_ORCA_CCACHE_DIR`), so a rebuild after a commit or a clean recompiles only what changed.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/ubuntu2604/build.sh` | Local container build: deps + slicer (`./build_linux.sh -dsr`); pass other `build_linux.sh` flags, or `-- COMMAND` to run any command in the same environment |
| `scripts/ubuntu2604/build.sh -isr` | Rebuild the slicer + AppImage locally |
| `scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh` | Same build + AppImage + test suite on a Runpod pod; about 4 minutes with warm caches |
| `scripts/ubuntu2604/gui-test/update-test.sh [normal\|force]` | Scripted in-app update test of an AppImage in a headless container |
| `scripts/ubuntu2604/gui-test/fix-model-test.sh [AppImage] PROJECT` | Scripted Fix model → arrange → slice → save test of a project or model file; run it through `remote-test.sh` (`SO_LOCAL=1` for the local container) |
| `scripts/ubuntu2604/gui-test/remote-test.sh TEST [:: TEST]...` | The GUI tests above on a Runpod CPU pod, without docker |
| `scripts/fork-sync/release.sh` | Build, test, smoke-slice and publish a fork release |
| `scripts/fork-sync/install.sh` | Install the timer that merges and releases new Snapmaker versions |

```shell
scripts/ubuntu2604/build.sh          # deps + slicer: ./build_linux.sh -dsr
scripts/ubuntu2604/build.sh -isr     # rebuild slicer + AppImage
```

Outputs: `build/package/snapmaker-orca` (run in place) and `build/Snapmaker_Orca_Linux_V*.AppImage`.
Host runtime needs: `libgtk-3-0t64`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`, `libopengl0` (present on a stock desktop install).

The 3D canvas should be a GLX canvas: `deps/wxWidgets` builds wxGLCanvas with `-DwxUSE_GLCANVAS_EGL=OFF` and `deps/GLEW` with `-DGLEW_USE_EGL=OFF` (the app forces `GDK_BACKEND=x11`, so on Wayland it runs on XWayland). `OpenGLManager.cpp` only warns (a build message and a log line at startup) when it is compiled against an EGL wx, so a system or Flatpak wx still builds; `scripts/ubuntu2604/check-gl-backend.sh APPIMAGE` is the check that fails: it inspects a built AppImage (or the `snapmaker-orca` binary) without starting it.

A wxGLCanvas built for EGL renders on Mesa but stays blank on NVIDIA's proprietary driver: a white canvas, no bed, no grid and no 3D toolbar, and nothing in the app log. wx picks the first `eglChooseConfig` match without matching it to the X visual of its GTK window; NVIDIA's EGL then refuses the window surface (`EGL_BAD_CONFIG`), the context is current without a surface and nothing is presented. Mesa's EGL accepts the surface, and so did Mesa's Zink on NVIDIA machines where it was active: the AppImage's `AppRun` forces Zink on drivers newer than 555 in a Wayland session, but only when `glxinfo` (package `mesa-utils`, not installed by default) is present.

`scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh` runs the same build (plus the AppImage and the test suite) on a temporary [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io) CPU pod: `cpu5c`, 16 vCPU (about $0.56/h) when the pod gets the cache volume and the tree has a dependencies key (also when that key is not cached yet: building the dependencies costs about the same pod-hours on 16 vCPU), 32 vCPU (about $1.1/h) when it must build the dependencies anyway (no volume, or a modified `deps/`); `RUNPOD_VCPU` overrides both. Only the AppImage comes back to `build/`. Caches live on a Runpod network volume (`snap-orca-cache`, 20 GB in `EU-RO-1`, about $1.4/month, created on first use): the built dependencies keyed by the `deps/` tree and `scripts/ubuntu2604/provision.sh`, a ccache of the slicer and tests, and ninja's build log, so the longest units start first. The key leaves out `deps/mesa` (a prebuilt Windows `opengl32.dll` that Snapmaker's tree has and the fork does not), so Snapmaker branches built with this script share the fork's dependencies. Without capacity in that data center the build runs uncached elsewhere (about 12–19 minutes including dependencies). The pod installs its packages (`provision.sh`, shared with the local container image) and unpacks the caches while the script connects. The pod is deleted when the script exits. As backstops, a detached local process deletes it after 3 hours, and so does the pod itself when Runpod gives it its own credentials (the script warns when it does not). A pod orphaned by this machine going down is otherwise only stopped by hand in the Runpod console. It needs a Runpod API key (`runpodctl doctor`, or `RUNPOD_API_KEY`), push access to the fork, and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. HEAD is pushed to a temporary `remote-build/<sha>` branch and uncommitted changes are copied over rsync. The commit hash reaches only `GUI_App.cpp` (through the generated `GitCommitHash.hpp`), so a new commit does not invalidate the cache.

An uncached pod goes to the data centers in `RUNPOD_POD_DCS`, tried in order (default `EUR-IS-1,EU-RO-1,EU-NL-1,EU-CZ-1,EU-SE-1,US-IL-1,US-KS-2,US-GA-2,US-WA-1,US-CA-2`: those with `cpu5c` first, then `cpu3c`, Europe first). Runpod sometimes schedules a CPU pod that never starts (no runtime, no SSH port) while it reports the data center's stock as high. A pod still without an SSH port after `RUNPOD_START_MINUTES` (default 4) is deleted (the script waits until the API returns 404) and replaced once, uncached, in the data centers of `RUNPOD_POD_DCS` after the one that failed; the log names the pod, its data center and the reason. To keep builds away from a data center, set `RUNPOD_POD_DCS` without it and, for the cache volume, `RUNPOD_DC` to another one (a new volume is created there on first use).

`REMOTE_EXTRA_CMD='…'` runs one more command in `build/` on the pod after the test suite, for example `REMOTE_EXTRA_CMD='ctest -C Release -R "batch lifecycle" --repeat until-fail:500'` to chase a flaky test without loading this machine. Arguments after the script name go to `ctest` (e.g. `remote-build.sh -R 'CGAL repair'`; a filter that matches no test fails the run), and `REMOTE_APPIMAGE=0` skips building and fetching the AppImage.

#### Build server (65.21.40.51)

The fork's default build/test host is the server `ultra@65.21.40.51` (16 cores, 30 GB, no root, no docker). `scripts/ubuntu2604/server-env.sh install` gives it a rootless toolchain: every package of `provision.sh` plus Xvfb, openbox, xdotool, wmctrl, ImageMagick, `x11-utils` and `mesa-utils` is fetched with `apt-get download`, unpacked with `dpkg -x` into `~/sysroot`, and CMake 3.30 is unpacked beside it. `source scripts/ubuntu2604/server-env.sh` sets `PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH` and the X/font paths for it (GL is Mesa llvmpipe).

```shell
scripts/ubuntu2604/server-build.sh [--name NAME] [CTEST_ARG...]   # rsync tree -> ~/work/NAME, build deps + app + tests, ctest
scripts/ubuntu2604/server-build.sh --name NAME --no-build -R 'CGAL repair'   # only ctest
scripts/ubuntu2604/server-build.sh --name NAME --cmd 'xvfb-run ...'          # any command in the tree, toolchain sourced
```

`build/` and `deps/build/` stay on the server under `~/work/NAME` (NAME defaults to the checkout's directory name), so rebuilds are incremental; the log is `~/work/NAME.log`. All runs take `flock ~/build.lock`, so heavy jobs queue instead of overlapping on the 16 cores. Exit codes: 11 build failed, 12 tests failed. For a headless GUI run: `Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x800x24 +extension GLX &`, `export DISPLAY=:99`, `openbox &`, then `xdotool`/`wmctrl`/`import -window root x.png` (after `source server-env.sh`).

`scripts/ubuntu2604/server-gui-smoke.sh APPIMAGE LABEL` is the headless GUI smoke of a built AppImage: it runs `check-gl-backend.sh`, extracts the AppImage, starts it on a private Xvfb (GLX, Mesa llvmpipe) with openbox and a fresh `HOME`, closes the setup wizard, opens the Prepare tab, saves screenshots under `~/work/gui-smoke/LABEL/shots/` and exits non-zero when the 3D canvas region is blank (one or a few colours, or almost entirely white). Run it under the build lock like any server job: `scripts/ubuntu2604/server-build.sh --name gui-smoke --cmd 'scripts/ubuntu2604/server-gui-smoke.sh ~/work/NAME/build/Snapmaker_Orca_Linux_V2.4.0.AppImage mesa'`. A plain `Xvfb`/`openbox` start with the stock sysroot does not get that far, because the server cannot do what Ubuntu 26.04's GUI stack assumes; `server-env.sh install-gui` (idempotent, run by the smoke script; builds do not need it) therefore adds, and `server_env_gui_activate` (also used by the smoke script) switches on:

- **Classic gdk-pixbuf.** gdk-pixbuf 2.44 of 26.04 has no loaders of its own: it decodes every image through glycin, which starts a bubblewrap sandbox, and the server forbids the unprivileged user namespaces bubblewrap needs (`setting up uid map: Permission denied`). GTK then aborts with `Bail out! Gtk:ERROR gtkiconhelper.c … No image loaders are configured`. The `libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0` 2.42.10 package of Ubuntu 24.04 (classic in-process loaders, PNG/JPEG built in; downloaded, checksum-verified and unpacked into `~/sysroot/classic-pixbuf`, with a generated `loaders.cache` exported as `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE`) goes first on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for GUI runs only; builds keep linking against the 26.04 library.
- **Locales.** Snapmaker Orca exits at start ("Switching language failed") without an `en_US`/`en_GB` locale, and the server has only `C`/`POSIX`: `localedef --no-archive` compiles both into `~/sysroot/locale` (`LOCPATH`).
- **WebKit helper processes.** The sysroot's `libwebkit2gtk-4.1` spawns `WebKitWebProcess` & co. from the compiled-in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/webkit2gtk-4.1` and ignores `WEBKIT_EXEC_PATH`; a copy with that prefix replaced by `/dev/shm/webkit2gtk-4.1` (a symlink to the sysroot directory) is used for GUI runs. WebKit also runs without its bubblewrap sandbox and GPU compositing, and with Mesa as EGL vendor.
- **`ldconfig` shim** (installed by plain `install`, active through `server_env_activate`'s `PATH`). The AppImage's start wrapper checks `ldconfig -p` for the host's OpenGL and WebKitGTK libraries; the shim in `~/sysroot/shim` also lists the sysroot's. Any other GUI run through `server-build.sh --cmd` needs `scripts/ubuntu2604/server-env.sh install-gui` once and `server_env_gui_activate` after `source server-env.sh`.

For a red/green loop, keep one pod with a session instead of a new pod per run (each new pod costs 1–2 minutes of start-up, checkout and provisioning):

```shell
scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh --session start               # pod + checkout of HEAD + provisioning
REMOTE_APPIMAGE=0 scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh --session run -R 'CGAL repair'
scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh --session run                 # full suite and the AppImage
scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh --session stop                # deletes the pod, waits for the API's 404
```

Each `run` copies the files that differ from the session's checkout now or did in an earlier run (content compared, so a reverted edit goes back too), then builds incrementally in the pod's build directory and runs `ctest`. The pod deletes itself, and a detached local process deletes it, `RUNPOD_MAX_HOURS` (default 3) after `start`; still, `stop` it when the loop ends, since an idle 16 vCPU pod costs about $0.56/h. The session state lives in the git directory, so every worktree uses the same pod; a session refuses to run after `deps/` or `provision.sh` changed (start a new one). Only one pod runs at a time: `remote-build.sh` and `remote-test.sh` share a lock in the git directory and refuse to start while the other runs; while a session pod exists, a plain `remote-build.sh` and `--session start` refuse, and `remote-test.sh` runs its GUI tests on the session pod and leaves it up. The state is dropped only when the Runpod API reports the pod gone (404); any other API answer stops the script with the state kept. Release builds (`release.sh`) use a fresh pod, so stop the session first.

To test the in-app AppImage self-update end to end, run `scripts/ubuntu2604/gui-test/update-test.sh [normal|force] [AppImage]` (the AppImage defaults to the newest `build/Snapmaker_Orca_Linux_V*.AppImage`; it is copied, never modified). The script builds the `snap-orca-guitest:26.04` image on first use and runs the app in a container with no network, no devices and a private headless Xvfb display, so nothing touches host USB devices or appears on screen. Inside, a local HTTP server offers a newer fork build (a marked copy of the same AppImage). The script closes the setup wizard, clicks Download and answers the restart question: Yes for `normal`, No for the forced update in `force`. It then checks that the installed AppImage matches the manifest sha256, that the app exited with 0 and opened no browser, and for `normal` that the relaunched instance kept `--datadir` and exited cleanly. Each check prints PASS/FAIL and the script exits non-zero on any failure; screenshots and logs go to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/snap-orca-gui-test/<variant>-<timestamp>/`. `SO_RO=1` runs a read-only control in which Download must fall back to the browser.

`scripts/ubuntu2604/gui-test/fix-model-test.sh [AppImage] PROJECT` loads a `.3mf` project or a model file (`.step`, `.stl`, …) in the same container (only with `SO_LOCAL=1`: a Fix model run on a big project takes minutes of full CPU and GBs of RAM, so the documented path is `remote-test.sh` below; without `SO_LOCAL=1` or `SO_DIRECT=1` it exits 2), selects every object and runs Fix model from the object list (skipped with `SO_FIX=0`, e.g. to check that a STEP file imports without mesh errors; Fix model is in the Linux menu only with the CGAL repair port, so use `SO_FIX=0` for other builds), arranges, slices and saves the project as `saved.3mf`. `analyze-3mf.py` then checks the saved mesh (open edges, winding, volume, size, inside the bed, no overlaps); `SO_ANALYZE_ARGS="--count N --volume V --size X,Y,Z"` sets the expectations. Results go to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/snap-orca-gui-test/fixmodel-<name>-<timestamp>/` (`SO_OUT` changes the root).

`scripts/ubuntu2604/gui-test/remote-test.sh` runs these tests on a temporary 8 vCPU `cpu5c` Runpod pod (about $0.28/h) instead of this machine, or on the `remote-build.sh` session pod while one exists, e.g. `remote-test.sh SO_FIX=0 fix-model-test.sh build/x.AppImage part.stp :: update-test.sh normal build/x.AppImage`. The pod installs `provision.sh` plus the GUI test packages (`gui-test/provision-gui.sh`, shared with the container image; skipped on a pod already provisioned by the same two scripts), receives every local file named in a test's arguments, and runs each test with `SO_DIRECT=1`: the driver uses the pod's own Xvfb as an unprivileged user instead of a container. The app's network is cut off only when the pod may unshare a network namespace; the log says which. Result folders and `remote-<timestamp>.log` (console, pod, price, run time) come back to `SO_OUT`, and a pod of its own is deleted on exit. `SO_DIRECT=1` is meant for such throwaway machines only, never the development laptop: it refuses to run without the `/etc/snap-orca-throwaway` marker that `remote-test.sh` creates on its pod.

`remote-test.sh` places its pod in the data centers of `RUNPOD_POD_DCS`, tried in order (default `EUR-IS-1,EU-RO-1,EU-NL-1,EU-CZ-1,EU-SE-1,US-IL-1,US-KS-2,US-GA-2,US-WA-1,US-CA-2`: those with `cpu5c` first, then `cpu3c`, Europe first). A pod without an SSH port after `RUNPOD_START_MINUTES` (default 4; Runpod sometimes schedules CPU pods that never start while reporting high stock) is deleted, verified gone (404), and replaced once in the data centers after the one that failed.

#### Command-line slicing

`--load-settings`/`--load-filaments` read a preset file as-is and do not follow `inherits`, so system presets must be flattened first (otherwise inherited values such as `filament_density` are missing):

```shell
scripts/flatten_profile.py -o /tmp/u1 \
    --machine "Snapmaker U1 (0.4 nozzle)" \
    --process "0.20mm Standard @Snapmaker U1 (0.4 nozzle)" \
    --filament "Snapmaker PLA Basic @U1"
build/package/snapmaker-orca --slice 0 --outputdir out --export-3mf out.3mf \
    --load-settings "/tmp/u1/machine-Snapmaker U1 (0.4 nozzle).json;/tmp/u1/process-0.20mm Standard @Snapmaker U1 (0.4 nozzle).json" \
    --load-filaments "/tmp/u1/filament-Snapmaker PLA Basic @U1.json" model.stl
```

The CLI skips plate thumbnails on Linux: it renders them through an OSMesa context, and the bundled GLEW cannot initialize on one (even with `libosmesa6` installed). G-code and 3MF are otherwise complete. If the printer screen needs a preview image, slice in the GUI, which renders thumbnails with the regular OpenGL context.

#### Releases and in-app updates

Linux builds check `ORCA_LINUX_UPDATE_URL` (`version.inc`; default: the fork's `releases/latest/download/version.json`) on startup and from Help → Check for Update. A release is offered when its Snapmaker version is newer, or equal with a higher `fork_build`. When the app runs from a writable AppImage, Download fetches the new AppImage, verifies its SHA-256, replaces the file in place and offers a restart. Otherwise it opens the download in the browser. Setting `orca_upgrade_url` in `Snapmaker_Orca.conf` overrides the manifest URL.

`scripts/fork-sync/release.sh [--merge <upstream-tag>] [--dry-run]` builds deps, the slicer, the AppImage and the tests, runs the test suite and a CLI smoke slice. The build and the tests run on the build server through `server-build.sh` (`BUILD_BACKEND=server`, the default; work directory `~/work/$SERVER_BUILD_NAME`, default `release`, so rebuilds are incremental) and the AppImage is fetched from there; `BUILD_BACKEND=runpod` uses a Runpod pod through `remote-build.sh` and `BUILD_BACKEND=local` the local container. The CLI smoke slice is `scripts/fork-sync/smoke-slice.sh`, run on the server or in the container. `BRANCH=<branch>` releases from another branch than `ubuntu-26.04`, for example from a worktree while the main checkout has `ubuntu-26.04` checked out; fast-forward `ubuntu-26.04` to it afterwards. It then bumps `ORCA_FORK_BUILD`, tags `v<version>-linux.<build>` and publishes the AppImage and `version.json` as the latest GitHub release. The bump is committed through the host's review-before-commit hook: release.sh stages it and runs `review diff --staged` in the background during the build (log: `release-review.log` in the git dir), so `review` (review-cli) must be on `PATH`; a failed review stops the release before the commit.

`--merge <tag>` merges on a side branch `fork-sync/<tag>` that starts at the upstream tag and merges `ubuntu-26.04` into it; `ubuntu-26.04` then fast-forwards to the merge. Upstream is therefore the merge's first parent, and the merge's own diff is the fork's delta re-applied to the new release (about 0.4 MB) instead of the whole upstream release (10–30 MB per Snapmaker release). That matters when the merge has conflicts: the commit that concludes it goes through the review-before-commit hook like any other, and review-cli truncates a diff over `REVIEW_DIFF_MAX_BYTES` (default 300 KB) and then writes no stamp, so an upstream-sized merge diff could never be reviewed and committed. The fork-sized one is reviewed in full with `REVIEW_DIFF_MAX_BYTES=1000000`. On conflicts release.sh exits 10 and leaves the checkout on `fork-sync/<tag>` (`ours` is upstream, `theirs` the fork): resolve, stage, run `review diff --staged`, commit, `git switch ubuntu-26.04` and rerun with the same `--merge`, which takes the committed merge. A merge without conflicts is committed by `git merge` itself and runs no pre-commit hook. `git log --first-parent ubuntu-26.04` follows upstream across each merge.

`scripts/fork-sync/install.sh` installs a systemd user timer (every 3 hours) that runs `check-upstream.sh`. When Snapmaker publishes a new stable release, the timer starts a headless `omp` session (`scripts/fork-sync/omp-prompt.md`). That session merges the tag, fixes conflicts and build/test failures, and publishes through `release.sh`. Logs go to `~/.local/state/snap-orca-sync/logs`, and a desktop notification reports the result. A failed tag is not retried until `check-upstream.sh --force <tag>`. No human reviews the merge before clients are offered it: the gates are the build, the test suite, the smoke slice and the review-cli board, which reviews the session's own commits (the resolution of a conflicted merge, fixes, the build bump) but not a merge without conflicts. Read the log after each notification; `gh release delete <tag>` withdraws a bad release (the manifest URL then resolves to the previous release, but clients that already updated keep the bad build until the next release).

#### Fix model

Fix model (right-click an object in the object list → "Fix model") is available in Linux builds of this fork. The feature is the CGAL repair of [OrcaSlicer#12155](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12155), ported by ealap; the repair itself now runs in [meshfix](https://github.com/alex-mextner/meshfix), a standalone MIT library with a C ABI and no CGAL dependency (vendored in `deps_src/meshfix`, called from `MeshBoolean::cgal::repair`; 3d-cli and Python use the same library). CGAL is still used to merge overlapping shells, which meshfix only reports. It runs on a copy of the object off the GUI thread, so the window stays responsive and Cancel leaves the object unchanged. Volumes that are already closed and consistently oriented are left untouched. Broken ones get duplicate vertices merged, degenerate faces removed, holes filled, faces reoriented, and nested shells kept as booleans by nesting level (a cavity stays a cavity).

Paint (color, supports, seams, fuzzy skin) on a repaired volume is lost, because its triangles change; untouched volumes keep it. Self-intersections cannot be removed without changing the shape, so Fix model reports them as a warning instead. Upstream drafts: [Snapmaker#991](https://github.com/Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer/pull/991), [OrcaSlicer#16360](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/16360).

#### STEP surface models

STEP bodies made of loose faces or open shells (surface models) are sewn on import. Where the sewn faces close into a shell, the body arrives as a closed solid without open edges; faces that cannot be closed (for example a box missing its top) are imported unchanged, open edges included. Upstream drafts: [Snapmaker#988](https://github.com/Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer/pull/988), [OrcaSlicer#16347](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/16347).

#### LAN printer auto-connect

After a printer has been connected once from the Device page, later starts reconnect to it in the background without switching to the Device tab. The printer re-issues TLS credentials for the stored client id (`server.client_manager.confirm_lan_status`), so no confirmation is needed on its screen. That reply arrives over plain MQTT, so it is accepted only for the stored serial number and client id, and only with the CA certificate seen on the previous connection (`last_connected_ca_sha256`, trust on first use). If the printer no longer authorizes the client or presents another CA, the app stays disconnected; add the printer again on the Device page. Opt out with Preferences → Presets → "Reconnect to the last LAN printer on startup" (`auto_connect_last_printer`).

### Linux Build

#### Linux Instructions

1. **Install system dependencies:**
   ```shell
   ./build_linux.sh -u
   ```

2. **Build dependencies:**
   ```shell
   ./build_linux.sh -d
   ```

3. **Build OrcaSlicer:**
   ```shell
   ./build_linux.sh -s
   ```

4. **Build AppImage (optional):**
   ```shell
   ./build_linux.sh -i
   ```

5. **All-in-one build (recommended):**
   ```shell
   ./build_linux.sh -dsi
   ```

**Additional build options:**

- `-b`: Build in debug mode
- `-c`: Force a clean build
- `-C`: Enable ANSI-colored compile output (GNU/Clang only)
- `-j N`: Limit builds to N cores (useful for low-memory systems)
- `-1`: Limit builds to one core
- `-l`: Use Clang instead of GCC
- `-p`: Disable precompiled headers (boost ccache hit rate)
- `-r`: Skip RAM and disk checks (for low-memory systems)

> [!NOTE]
> The build script automatically detects your Linux distribution and uses the appropriate package manager (apt, pacman) to install dependencies.

> [!TIP]
> For first-time builds, use `./build_linux.sh -u` to install dependencies, then `./build_linux.sh -dsi` to build everything.

> [!WARNING]
> If you encounter memory issues during compilation, use `-j 1` or `-1` to limit parallel compilation, or `-r` to skip memory checks.

## Portable User Configuration

If you want OrcaSlicer to use a custom user configuration folder (e.g., for a portable installation), you can simply place a folder named `data_dir` next to the OrcaSlicer executable. OrcaSlicer will automatically use this folder as its configuration directory.

This allows for multiple self-contained installations with separate user data.

> [!TIP]
> This feature is especially useful if you want to run OrcaSlicer from a USB stick or keep different profiles isolated.

### Example folder structure

```shell
OrcaSlicer.exe
data_dir/
```

You don’t need to recompile or modify any settings — this works out of the box as long as `data_dir` exists in the same folder as the executable.
