#
# --merge   first merge the given Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer release tag into the release branch
# --dry-run build, test and assemble dist/ but do not commit the build bump, push or publish
#
# Exit codes: 10 merge conflict (resolve on branch fork-sync/<tag>, review, commit, switch back

# other non-zero: usage / environment errors.
#
# The upstream tag is merged on the side branch fork-sync/<tag>, which starts at the tag and
# merges the release branch into it; the release branch then fast-forwards to that merge. With
# upstream as the first parent, the merge's own diff (`git diff --cached` while conflicts are
# resolved, which the host's review-before-commit hook requires `review diff --staged` to have
# passed on) is the fork's delta re-applied to the new release, a few hundred KB the reviewers
# can read. Merged the other way round it would be the whole upstream release (10-30 MB per
# Snapmaker release), which review-cli truncates and therefore never stamps, so a conflicted
# merge could not be committed. A merge without conflicts runs no pre-commit hook.
#
# BUILD_BACKEND=server (default) builds and tests on the build server (scripts/ubuntu2604/server-build.sh,
# $SERVER, work dir ~/work/$SERVER_BUILD_NAME, so a rebuild is incremental) and fetches the AppImage;
# BUILD_BACKEND=runpod builds and tests on a temporary Runpod CPU pod (scripts/ubuntu2604/remote-build.sh,
# ~$1/h, deleted afterwards); BUILD_BACKEND=local builds in the local container and occupies all cores
# of this machine. The CLI smoke slice (scripts/fork-sync/smoke-slice.sh) runs on the server for the
# server backend, in the build container otherwise.
#
# The build bump commit goes through this host's review-before-commit git hook, which accepts
# it only after `review diff --staged` passed on exactly that staged diff. release.sh stages
# the bump and reviews it in the background while the build runs (log: release-review.log in
# the git dir; task code $REVIEW_TASK_CODE, default fork-release-<tag>), then waits for it
# before committing. A failed review stops the release before the commit.
#
# The release carries the AppImage and version.json, the manifest that Linux builds poll
# (ORCA_LINUX_UPDATE_URL in version.inc points at releases/latest/download/version.json).
